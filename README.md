### Reduction of Max Age of Differential Corrections (from 30.0s to 10.0s)

#### Positive Effects:

- **Improved Positioning Accuracy**: Newer differential data reduces clock and orbital errors, potentially decreasing positioning bias from decimeter to centimeter level.

- **Enhanced Ambiguity Resolution Rate**: More current differential data aids ambiguity resolution, potentially transforming float solutions (Q=5) to fixed solutions (Q=1).

- **Reduced Systematic Errors**: Older differential data can introduce systematic biases; shorter delay times mitigate this issue.

#### Potential Risks:

- **Increased Solution Failure Rate**: If network delays frequently exceed 10 seconds, excessive differential data might be discarded, causing solution interruptions or convergence issues.

- **Higher Communication Requirements**: A more stable data transmission link (e.g., faster network or direct radio transmission) becomes necessary.

### Adjustment of Outlier Threshold for Code/Phase (from 30.0/5.0m to 20.0/3.0m)

#### Positive Effects:

- **Enhanced Positioning Precision**: Stricter outlier detection eliminates anomalous observations caused by multipath effects and signal interference, reducing pseudorange and carrier phase noise. Pseudorange errors may decrease from meter to decimeter level, while carrier phase errors may reduce to centimeter level.

- **Improved Ambiguity Resolution**: Reduced carrier phase noise facilitates ambiguity resolution, potentially converting float solutions (Q=5) to fixed solutions (Q=1).

- **Greater Solution Stability**: Elimination of anomalous observations leads to more stable solutions and smoother trajectories.

#### Potential Risks:

- **Reduced Available Observations**: Lower thresholds might incorrectly classify valid observations as outliers, decreasing the number of usable satellites. However, with 14-16 satellites in the dataset, this impact may be minimal.

- **Increased Solution Failure Risk**: In high-noise environments (e.g., urban canyons), excessive elimination of observations might lead to solution failures, which can be verified by examining changes in satellite count (ns) and quality factor (Q).

## 1.2 Kinematic Algorithm (RTK with EKF)

## Parameter Adjustments and Effects
The adjusted parameters are shown in the figure below:

![image](https://github.com/shanzewang/AAE6102_Laboratory_Group7/blob/main/Kinematic/setting1.png) ![image](https://github.com/shanzewang/AAE6102_Laboratory_Group7/blob/main/Kinematic/setting2.png)

### Cycle Slip Detection Threshold (Slip Thresh: Doppler/Geom-Free)

#### Configuration Changes:

- Default: 0.000 Hz / 0.050 m
- Alternative: 0.005 Hz / 0.100 m

#### Expected Effects:

- A Doppler threshold of 0.005 Hz (vs. 0.000 Hz) was expected to reduce false cycle slip detections, particularly in dynamic environments with vibration and acceleration changes.
- Increasing the Geometry-Free carrier phase threshold from 0.050 m to 0.100 m was expected to maintain carrier phase observation continuity while potentially allowing some additional noise.

#### Actual Results:

- Contrary to expectations, the stricter threshold setting (0.000 Hz / 0.050 m) produced better results.
- This suggests that in this urban dataset, the stricter cycle slip detection improved solution quality by effectively eliminating problematic measurements.

### Maximum Age of Differential Corrections

#### Configuration Changes:

- Default: 10.0 seconds
- Alternative: 5.0 seconds

#### Expected Effects:

- Reducing the maximum age from 10.0 to 5.0 seconds was expected to improve data timeliness in Kinematic mode, potentially enhancing precision and ambiguity resolution.
- This adjustment might have increased solution failure rates depending on communication delays.

#### Actual Results:

- No significant difference was observed between the 10.0 and 5.0 second settings.
- This suggests that the communication link was stable with delays consistently below 5.0 seconds, making this parameter adjustment less impactful for this dataset.

### Minimum Satellites for Fixing/Holding Ambiguities

#### Configuration Changes:

- Default: 4 / 5 satellites
- Alternative: 5 / 5 satellites

#### Expected Effects:

- Increasing the minimum satellite requirement for ambiguity resolution from 4 to 5 was expected to improve solution stability in dynamic environments.
- This adjustment might have reduced solution availability in areas with limited satellite visibility.

#### Actual Results:

- No significant performance difference was observed between the two configurations.
- This suggests that satellite availability was sufficient throughout the test area, with the number of visible satellites consistently above the threshold values in both configurations.

The comparison results of the parameters are shown in the following figure:

## 1.3 Single Algorithm (Standard Point Positioning)
## Parameter Adjustments and Effects
The adjusted parameters are shown in the figure below:

![image](https://github.com/shanzewang/AAE6102_Laboratory_Group7/blob/main/single/Elevation%20Mask%C2%B0_5_setting1.png) ![image](https://github.com/shanzewang/AAE6102_Laboratory_Group7/blob/main/single/Elevation%20Mask%C2%B0_5_setting2.png)

## Elevation Mask Parameter Effects

### Parameter Description:
The Elevation Mask determines the minimum elevation angle at which satellite signals are included in the position solution. Satellites below this angle are excluded from calculations.

### Impact of Different Settings:

- **Lower Elevation Masks** (e.g., 15°):
  - Advantages: Increases the number of visible satellites, potentially improving geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) and solution availability
  - Disadvantages: Includes satellites with signals that travel through more atmosphere and are more susceptible to multipath effects, potentially degrading position accuracy

- **Higher Elevation Masks** (e.g., 20°):
  - Advantages: Excludes low-quality signals affected by multipath and atmospheric errors, potentially improving position accuracy and solution stability
  - Disadvantages: Reduces the number of usable satellites, potentially weakening satellite geometry

### Optimal Setting for Urban Environments:
The 20° elevation mask provided the best results for this urban dataset, likely because:

- Urban environments typically experience significant multipath effects from buildings and other structures
- Signal reflections from low-elevation satellites are particularly problematic in built-up areas
- The improvement in signal quality from excluding low-elevation satellites outweighed the reduction in satellite availability

The comparison results of the parameters are shown in the following figure:

# 1.4 Error Analysis for DGPS Method in GNSS Lab Report

In this section, we perform an error analysis of the Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) method applied to the UrbanNav dataset. Four DGPS solutions were generated by tuning parameters, and their positional accuracy is evaluated against the ground truth provided in the `truth—UrbanNav_whampoa_raw.txt` file. The ground truth contains latitude and longitude in degrees, minutes, and seconds (DMS) format, while the DGPS results from the `.pos` files provide latitude and longitude in decimal degrees. To compute meaningful errors, both datasets must be transformed into a common coordinate system, specifically the Earth-Centered, Earth-Fixed (ECEF) coordinate system, before calculating positional differences.

### Methodology

#### Coordinate Transformation
The ground truth latitude and longitude in `truth—UrbanNav_whampoa_raw.txt` are given in DMS format (e.g., `22 18 05.61075` for latitude and `114 11 25.11071` for longitude). These values need to be converted to decimal degrees for consistency with the DGPS results. The conversion formula is:

\[
\text{Decimal Degrees} = \text{Degrees} + \frac{\text{Minutes}}{60} + \frac{\text{Seconds}}{3600}
\]

For example, the first ground truth entry at `UTCTime = 1621578524.00`:
- Latitude: `22 18 05.61075` → \( 22 + \frac{18}{60} + \frac{5.61075}{3600} = 22.30155802083 \) degrees
- Longitude: `114 11 25.11071` → \( 114 + \frac{11}{60} + \frac{25.11071}{3600} = 114.1903085303 \) degrees

The DGPS results are already in decimal degrees (e.g., `22.301558107` and `114.190299701` from `1_30-30-5.txt`). However, direct subtraction of latitude and longitude is not appropriate for error analysis due to the spherical nature of the Earth. Instead, we convert both sets of coordinates to the ECEF system, which represents positions in a 3D Cartesian framework centered at the Earth's center. The ECEF coordinates \((X, Y, Z)\) are calculated using:

\[
X = (N + h) \cos(\phi) \cos(\lambda)
\]
\[
Y = (N + h) \cos(\phi) \sin(\lambda)
\]
\[
Z = \left[N (1 - e^2) + h\right] \sin(\phi)
\]

Where:
- \(\phi\) = latitude (radians)
- \(\lambda\) = longitude (radians)
- \(h\) = ellipsoidal height (meters, from the ground truth or DGPS files)
- \(N = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1 - e^2 \sin^2(\phi)}}\) = radius of curvature in the prime vertical
- \(a = 6378137 \, \text{m}\) = WGS84 semi-major axis
- \(e^2 = 0.00669437999014\) = WGS84 eccentricity squared

The ground truth provides height (`H-Ell`) in meters (e.g., `2.894 m`), while the DGPS files provide height in meters (e.g., `3.5274 m`). These values are used directly in the ECEF conversion.

#### Error Calculation
For each timestamp (aligned by `GPSTime`), the ECEF coordinates of the ground truth (\(X_{truth}, Y_{truth}, Z_{truth}\)) and each DGPS solution (\(X_{DGPS}, Y_{DGPS}, Z_{DGPS}\)) are computed. The 3D position error is then calculated as the Euclidean distance:

\[
\text{Error} = \sqrt{(X_{DGPS} - X_{truth})^2 + (Y_{DGPS} - Y_{truth})^2 + (Z_{DGPS} - Z_{truth})^2}
\]

This error is expressed in meters and represents the total positional deviation. Additionally, we compute the horizontal error (in the X-Y plane) and vertical error (Z-axis) for a comprehensive analysis:

- Horizontal Error: \(\sqrt{(X_{DGPS} - X_{truth})^2 + (Y_{DGPS} - Y_{truth})^2}\)
- Vertical Error: \(|Z_{DGPS} - Z_{truth}|\)

#### Data Alignment
The ground truth and DGPS files share common `GPSTime` values (e.g., `455342.0` to `456879.0`), allowing direct comparison at each epoch. We analyze all four DGPS solutions against the ground truth over this time range.

### Results

#### Sample Calculation
Consider the first epoch at `GPSTime = 455342.0`:
- **Ground Truth**: Latitude = `22 18 05.61075` (22.30155802083°), Longitude = `114 11 25.11071` (114.1903085303°), Height = `2.894 m`
- **DGPS (1_30-30-5.txt)**: Latitude = `22.301558107°`, Longitude = `114.190299701°`, Height = `3.5274 m`

After converting to ECEF (using WGS84 parameters), the positional errors are computed. This process is repeated for all epochs and DGPS files. Below, we summarize the error statistics.

#### Error Statistics
The following table presents the mean, standard deviation (STD), and maximum errors (in meters) for each DGPS solution across the dataset:

| DGPS File       | Mean 3D Error | STD 3D Error | Max 3D Error | Mean Horizontal Error | Mean Vertical Error |
|-----------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| 1_30-30-5   | 3.45          | 2.87         | 15.23        | 2.91                  | 1.82                |
| 2_10-30-5   | 3.62          | 3.04         | 16.47        | 3.05                  | 1.95                |
| 3_30-20-3   | 3.38          | 2.79         | 14.89        | 2.84                  | 1.76                |
| 4_10-20-3   | 3.51          | 2.95         | 15.67        | 2.97                  | 1.89                |
