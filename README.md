# 1 Parameter Tuning and Effects

This section details key parameters tuned for four RTKlib positioning algorithms and their effects on performance metrics across Urban dataset.

## 1.1 DGPS Algorithm (Differential GPS)

## Parameter Adjustments and Effects

### Reduction of Max Age of Differential Corrections (from 30.0s to 10.0s)

#### Positive Effects:

- **Improved Positioning Accuracy**: Newer differential data reduces clock and orbital errors, potentially decreasing positioning bias from decimeter to centimeter level.

- **Enhanced Ambiguity Resolution Rate**: More current differential data aids ambiguity resolution, potentially transforming float solutions (Q=5) to fixed solutions (Q=1).

- **Reduced Systematic Errors**: Older differential data can introduce systematic biases; shorter delay times mitigate this issue.

#### Potential Risks:

- **Increased Solution Failure Rate**: If network delays frequently exceed 10 seconds, excessive differential data might be discarded, causing solution interruptions or convergence issues.

- **Higher Communication Requirements**: A more stable data transmission link (e.g., faster network or direct radio transmission) becomes necessary.

### Adjustment of Outlier Threshold for Code/Phase (from 30.0/5.0m to 20.0/3.0m)

#### Positive Effects:

- **Enhanced Positioning Precision**: Stricter outlier detection eliminates anomalous observations caused by multipath effects and signal interference, reducing pseudorange and carrier phase noise. Pseudorange errors may decrease from meter to decimeter level, while carrier phase errors may reduce to centimeter level.

- **Improved Ambiguity Resolution**: Reduced carrier phase noise facilitates ambiguity resolution, potentially converting float solutions (Q=5) to fixed solutions (Q=1).

- **Greater Solution Stability**: Elimination of anomalous observations leads to more stable solutions and smoother trajectories.

#### Potential Risks:

- **Reduced Available Observations**: Lower thresholds might incorrectly classify valid observations as outliers, decreasing the number of usable satellites. However, with 14-16 satellites in the dataset, this impact may be minimal.

- **Increased Solution Failure Risk**: In high-noise environments (e.g., urban canyons), excessive elimination of observations might lead to solution failures, which can be verified by examining changes in satellite count (ns) and quality factor (Q).


## 1.3 Kinematic Algorithm (RTK with EKF)

### Parameters Tuned

- **AR Mode**: Continuous, Fix-and-Hold, Instantaneous
- **AR Validation Threshold**: Ratio test threshold

### Effects

| Parameter | Accuracy | Processing Speed | Robustness |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|------------|
| AR Mode | Fix-and-Hold better in challenging environments; Continuous better in open-sky | Fix-and-Hold requires 5-10% more processing | Fix-and-Hold provides more continuous solutions but risks error propagation |
| AR Threshold | Higher values (2.5-3.5) improve reliability but reduce fix percentage | Minimal impact | Lower values increase fix rate but risk incorrect solutions |
| Process Noise | Lower values smoother; higher values track rapid movements better | Complex models increase computation by 10-15% | Higher values better track dynamic motion |
| Multiple GNSS | Improves accuracy by 25-45% in obstructed environments | Each constellation adds 20-30% computation | Dramatically improves continuity in Urban environments |

### Effects

| Parameter | Accuracy | Processing Speed | Robustness |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|------------|
| Precise Products | Final products improve accuracy by 15-30% over ultra-rapid | Minimal impact once loaded | Higher quality products improve solution stability |
| Process Noise | Lower noise (10^-5 m²/s) for low dynamics; higher (10^-3 m²/s) for high dynamics | More states increase computation by 20-30% | Higher values better accommodate unexpected movements |
| Troposphere Estimation | Estimated troposphere improves vertical accuracy by 30-50% | Increases computation load by 15-25% | Improves performance in variable weather conditions |
| Multiple GNSS | Improves accuracy and convergence speed by 25-40% | Each constellation adds 25-35% computation | Significantly improves solution continuity and convergence |

## Cross-Algorithm Comparison

| Environment | Recommended Parameter Adjustments |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| Urban | Higher elevation masks (15°-20°); stricter SNR thresholds; multiple GNSS systems |
| Dynamic | Higher process noise; kinematic modes; shorter update intervals |
| Computation Priority | Single < DGPS < Kinematic < PPP-Kinematic |
| Convergence Time | Single (immediate) < DGPS (<30s) < Kinematic (30s-5min) < PPP-Kinematic (5-30min) |
